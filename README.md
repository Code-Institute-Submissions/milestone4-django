# Guitar World
#### Milestone Project 4: Full Stack Frameworks with Django
The purpose of this project was to design and implement an application with the following two functions. 
* Firstly to allow users to purchase instruments online.
* And secondly, to allow users to use this application to search instrument spec and reviews.

For optimal performance it is recommended to use Google Chrome browser.

The Project can be viewed [here](https://guitar-world-shop.herokuapp.com/ ).
 
### UX Design

#### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
The approach to the SDLC included the following phases:
* User requirement gathering.
* Functional Specification.
* Design Specification.
* Development.
* Testing.
* User acceptance.
* Deployment.

**User requirements gathering** - First part of the requirements gathering phase of this project included interviewing a musician
to find out what they would like to see as key features on an online instrument shop application. Second part of the requirements gathering 
phase included researching what a typical user would like to see as key functionalities in searching instrument reviews on an 
application.

**Functional Specification** - Having gathered the user requirements a functional specification was developed.
This functional specification included key features such as 
* Input template (admin)
* Data entry form (admin)
* Search functionality for finding instrument
* One URL which allows you to submit or search an instrument
* Ease of use
 

**Design Specification** - Based on the key functionalities a design specification
was developed. This specification resulted in the following technologies that where used 
in meeting the requirements for this project.  
##### Technologies Used
* Python 
* HTML5
* CSS / Bootstrap
* Javascript / JQuery
* Stripe
* Heroku
* GIT

**Development** - The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) PyCharm was used as the development platform for this project which
is a segragated environment from the live environment.
Github was used as the source code repository which also provided version control and release management.    
 
**Testing** - The test strategy that was used throughout this project that ensured a quality of delivery for the application
included the following.
* Unit Testing
  * The application was broken down into individual units before the development phase. Each of these units represented
  the key functionalities of the application which where tested seperately.   
* Integration Testing
  * As the application consists of a Frontend web-application supported by a Backend database. Integration testing was 
  necessary to ensure integrety of the links. 
* User Acceptance Testing
  * User Acceptance Testing was performed to ensure that the key functionality and user requirements gathered at the start 
  of the project where successfully delivered.  
* Regression Testing
  * In order to ensure the application was fully functional in the live environment regression testing was performed on key functionalities.
   
**Deployment** - As this application was an initial deployment it was put into a live environment following the completion 
of successful testing mentioned previously. The application will be maintained in the live environment and upgraded as necessary.
Deployment of future updates will be controlled within a maintenance window which will be notified to users to minimise disruption.  

#### Future Implements:
* Categories for different Instruments
* One Click feature for instrument ratings (1-5 stars)
